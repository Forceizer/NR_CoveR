# NR_CoveR
A fork of the Rainmeter skin "NR_CoveR" with added WebNowPlaying support (which spans **all the web music players** as well as Spotify's desktop app). To make the Spotify desktop client work, however, you need to follow the [official guide](https://wnp.keifufu.dev/spicetify) from the developers of the WebNowPlaying plugin.
